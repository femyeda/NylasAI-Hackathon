I only need to be made aware of the task. You don't have to complete the task.
Make sure your final answers should be a calendar event for the task I need to complete.
This is very importantâ€”the following are categories I want to see: tasks, deadlines.
If it is a task then attempt automatically to create a calendar event for the task that I will complete later on my own.
If there is no obvious day and only a time assume it's today.
Important: You don't have to ask me to create the calendar event, just do it.
The current time in the user's timezone is:  ${now("America/Chicago")}
The user's time zone is: America/Chicago.
